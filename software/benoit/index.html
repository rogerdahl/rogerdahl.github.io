<p>This project consists of two apps, an editor and a player. Use the editor to
create and edit fractal zoom specifications, called tracks, and then play them
back in the player.</p>
<p>The player renders the tracks in realtime, creating a continuously running
fractal zooming show. It comes with a set of completed tracks (courtesy of yours
truly), so the editor is only needed if there is a desire to create custom
tracks (which I hope people will take the time to do).</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="requirements">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id5">Requirements</a><a class="headerlink" href="#requirements" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<ul class="simple">
<li>A high end NVIDIA graphics card in the GTX 2xx or newer series.</li>
<li>A 64 bit version of Windows.</li>
</ul>
<p>Lower end workstation or embedded graphics cards (such as the ones used in
laptops) will probably not be able to run this app satisfactorily.</p>
<div class="section" id="benoit-player">
<h3>Benoit Player<a class="headerlink" href="#benoit-player" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The player reads fractal zoom specifications from .benoit track files created
in the editor and renders them as colorful fractal zooms in realtime.</p>
<img alt="../../_images/player.jpg" src="../../_images/player.jpg" />
<p>The player comes with a configuration file that has been optimized for an
NVIDIA GTX 570 graphics card. If the target machine has this or a better card,
tracks should play smoothly with good quality.</p>
<p>To start the player with the default tracks and default configuration, download
the executable, uncompress it to a convenient location, such as the Desktop, and
double click the player.exe file. For the best results, enable triple buffering
in the NVIDIA Control Panel.</p>
<p>If you get error <em>CUDA driver version is insufficient for CUDA runtime
version</em>, try updating your graphics card driver.</p>
<p>If you get error <em>The application has failed to start because its side-by-side
configuration is incorrect</em>, double-click the included vcredist_x64.exe file
and follow the prompts. You only have to do this once.</p>
<p>If you get error <em>Not a valid Win32 application</em>, note that this app currently
supports only 64 bit Windows. If you get this error on a 64 bit version of
Windows, please let me know.</p>
<p>During playback, click to pause and right-click to view the log scale map. In
the log scale map, all four sides of a fractal box are lined up on a single
line.</p>
<p>If the target machine has a high end graphics card that is less powerful than a
GTX 570, it may still be able to run the player with satisfactory rendering
quality and frame rate by modifying the player&#8217;s configuration file. See the
<a class="reference internal" href="#configuration-file">configuration file</a> section for details on how to edit the file for optimal
rendering quality on your machine.</p>
<p>If the target machine has a graphics card that is significantly faster than the
GTX 570, it may be desirable to modify the player configuration to take
advantage of the extra processing power. Again, refer to the configuration file
section.</p>
<p>Note that the app can not take advantage of additional GPUs in a multi-GPU
setup.</p>

<h3>Benoit Editor<a class="headerlink" href="#benoit-editor" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The editor lets you create fractal zoom specifications, .benoit track files, to
be rendered in realtime in the player.</p>
<p>A track contains a vanishing point to zoom towards, starting and ending zoom
levels and key colors for creating palettes for frames in the zoom.</p>
<div class="figure">
<a class="reference internal image-reference" href="../../_images/editor.jpg"><img alt="../../_images/editor.jpg" src="../../_images/editor.jpg" style="width: 100%;" /></a>
</div>
<p>I created this tool because I feel that when coloring a fractal, the palette,
in addition to providing colors, is an important tool for emphasizing and
suppressing details in the fractal. So instead of just assigning palettes
to fractals programmatically, I wanted a tool that would enable exact adjustment
of the colors for given details in the fractals.</p>
<p>The basic idea behind the editor is to enable coloring of an entire fractal zoom
by only specifying a few key colors. <em>Spatial and temporal palettes</em> are just my
Star Trekian names for two simple concepts. A spatial palette is a palette for a
single frame in the series of frames that make up a zoom. A temporal palette is
the palette for an entire zoom.</p>
<p>A spatial palette is made up of one or more spatial keys. The spatial keys
specify colors for specific escape times in a specific frame of the zoom. Colors
for all the escape times in a frame are created automatically by interpolating
between the given spatial keys.</p>
<p>Spatial palettes themselves are keys in the temporal palette. Each spatial
palette key specifies the palette in one frame in the zoom. The entire temporal
palette is made by interpolating between the temporal palette keys.</p>
<p>For instance, to create a track which starts out by using only gray tones and
which, over time during the zoom, slowly shifts to using shades between red and
green, create a temporal palette that contains two temporal keys. The first
temporal key would be on the complete left (the location for the beginning of
the zoom), and contain two spatial keys, one white and one black. The second
temporal key would be on the complete right (the location for the end of the
zoom), it would also contain two spatial keys, one red and one green.</p>
<div class="section" id="how-to-use-the-editor">
<h4>How to use the editor<a class="headerlink" href="#how-to-use-the-editor" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<ul>
<li><p class="first">To zoom into the fractal, click in the image. To zoom out, right-click. Both
when left- and right clicking, the clicked position is used as the center for
the new image.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">To change the zoom level between the highest and lowest zoom level that you
have been at in the track, drag the scrubber. The numbers on the left and
right sides of the scrubber indicate the highest and lowest zoom levels.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">The lowest zoom level is the level to which you have clicked. Zooming out
decreases the lowest zoom level.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">To create a spatial key, click in the open area above the spatial palette. The
key is created at that location and with a color that is the same as the
interpolated color is in that position. This enables creating spatial keys
that do not modify the current palette until their colors are adjusted. If a
duplicate of an existing key is desired instead, focus the existing key by
clicking on it, then select Edit | Duplicate spatial key.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">To delete a spatial key, right click it. The last spatial key can not be
deleted.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">To create a temporal key, click in the open area above the temporal palette.
The new temporal key is a copy of the closest existing temporal key, so this
is also how temporal keys are copied.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">To delete a temporal key, right click it. The last temporal key can not be
deleted.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">To modify a temporal key, give it focus by clicking it. Focus is shown as a
thin dotted line around the key. When focus is set to a temporal key, the
zoom scrubber is moved to match that location. This is so that when the temporal
key is edited, the changes are shown in the frame for which the temporal key
applies.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">To modify the color of a spatial key, give it focus by clicking it. Then drag
the RGB sliders.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">To modify the positions of spatial and temporal keys, drag them.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Press the numeric keys 1 to 9 on the keyboard to assign a randomly generated
spatial palette to the currently focused temporal key. The spatial palette
will have the same number of spatial keys as the number that was pressed. More
colors create a fractal that looks more &#8220;busy&#8221;. If the zoom scrubber is not at
the location of the currently focused temporal key, it is moved there, and the
fractal is updated accordingly. Usually, you will want to generate a palette
for a new zoom level that you have arrived at by clicking in the fractal. To
accomplish that, create a new temporal key or use an existing key and drag it
all the way to the right (which is your current position if you have not moved
the scrubber after right- or left clicking in the fractal), then press a key
between 1 and 9.</p>
<p>This function positions the spatial keys to evenly divide the colors between
the calculated escape times, so it works best after the fractal has been fully
rendered.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Setting the calculation type in the Calculation menu and supersampling in the
Supersample menu only affects how the fractal is calculated and rendered in
the editor. It has no effect in the player.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">A higher bailout value enhances detail in the fractal. However, a higher
bailout values also increases the fractal calculation time and makes it less
likely that the player can rendered the track in realtime.</p>
<p>All tracks that are to be played at the same time must use the same bailout
value. If the bailout values do not match between tracks in a set, the player
will select the lowest value and use it for all tracks.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">The editor can be associated with .benoit files, so that tracks can be opened
for editing by double clicking them in Explorer. On Windows 7, right-click a
.benoit file, select <em>Open With</em>, <em>Chose default program</em> and browse to the
editor.exe file.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="example">
<h4>Example<a class="headerlink" href="#example" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>The easiest way to create a track consists of these steps:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Select File | New.</li>
<li>Click in the fractal image to zoom. Keep clicking on interesting looking
details until the resolution becomes bad. This takes around 20 clicks. If
necessary, right click to back up. During this part, drag the black and white
spatial keys if necessary to see details in the images.</li>
<li>Drag the temporal key to the middle.</li>
<li>Wait for the fractal to render for this position. Then press numeric keys
between 2 and 9 on the keyboard until an interesting looking combination of
colors appear.</li>
<li>Drag the spatial keys to emphasize the details that you want to show and
to suppress the details you want to hide.</li>
<li>Create a copy of the temporal key by clicking next to it. Drag the new key
most of the way to the left. Wait for the fractal to render.</li>
<li>Drag the spatial keys to emphasize the details in this location. It is
best to keep the relative positions of the keys the same, so that the
colors are not swapping places during playback of the track.</li>
<li>Create another copy of the center temporal key by clicking next to it. Drag
this key most of the way to the right. Again, drag the keys to emphasize
the details.</li>
<li>Drag the scrubber to check what the fractal will look like in the
interpolated areas. Modify existing temporal keys or create new ones if
necessary.</li>
<li>Save the track in the player&#8217;s tracks folder.</li>

<img alt="../../_images/log_map.jpg" class="align-left" src="../../_images/log_map.jpg" />
<p>This is a photo taken on a pier. Imagine that the pier was infinitely long.
The point into which the walkway would seem to disappear in the distance is
called the vanishing point.</p>
<p>The lamp posts are spaced evenly along the pier but as they get closer to the
vanishing point, the number of pixels between each lamp post becomes lower.
The number of pixels between each lamp post is a logarithmic function of how
close to the vanishing point the lamp posts are.</p>
<p>To create an illusion of traveling towards the vanishing point in this image,
progressively smaller sections of the image can be enlarged. However, because
the resolution is the same across the entire image, the resolution will be
reduced as the process is repeated, creating an image that is progressively
more blurred.</p>
<p>If the lowered resolution is compensated for by distorting the image in such a
way that the same number of pixels is stored between each lamp post regardless
of how close the lamp post is to the vanishing point, a log scale map has been
created. In other words, a log scale map is simply an image in which the
resolution increases the closer the pixels are to the vanishing point.</p>
<p>With this log scale map, progressively smaller sections of the image can be
enlarged around the vanishing point without the resolution becoming lower.</p>
<p>Translating this to the problem at hand, creating a realtime fractal zoom, the
point towards which the zoom progresses becomes the vanishing point. It is in
the exact center of the screen. As progressively smaller sections of the
fractal image are rendered, new fractal image data is calculated for a portion
of the fractal that is <em>inside</em> the vanishing point, where it can not yet be
seen. However, the content is added with a resolution that is sufficient to
display it at a good resolution even when it is displayed at the outer edges of
the screen. In essence, the fractal data is reused at many different scales.</p>
<p>By using this technique, the problem of creating a realtime fractal zoom is
shifted from being an issue of calculating fractal escape times fast enough,
towards being more of a pixel manipulation issue, at which the graphics card
happens to excel.</p>
<p>There is also an interesting synergy between the way this technique causes the
fractal to be rendered and the way the human eye and brain works. Since the
same fractal data is used at many different scales, the display resolution of
the fractal data is higher the closer it is to the vanishing point in the
center of the screen. When zooming into the fractal, the eyes and attention of
the viewer are also naturally drawn towards the vanishing point, where new
fractal detail emerges. The combined effect is that the imagery shows with the
highest resolution where it gets the most attention. In addition, as fractal
details become larger and start losing resolution, they move towards the outer
edges of the screen and in the process, both move into the peripheral vision
of the observer and pick up apparent speed &#8211; both factors that help hide the
fact that the resolution is becoming lower. The end result is that the fractal
can be calculated in such a way that it provides fairly low detail towards the
edges of the screen without the effect being readily noticeable by the viewer.</p>
<p>The main limitation of this technique is that the zoom can&#8217;t change directions
without creating an entirely new log scale map.</p>

<div class="section" id="configuring-the-player">
<span id="configuration-file"></span><h3>Configuring the player<a class="headerlink" href="#configuring-the-player" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The player has a number of configuration settings, stored in the <strong>player.cfg</strong>
file. The goal is to set these in such a way that the highest possible quality
animation that your graphics card can generate is attained while maintaining the
same framerate at which your monitor runs.</p>
<p>Example: Most LCD monitors run at 60 Hz. That gives the graphics card 16.7ms to
calculate one frame. The player should be configured in such a way that each
frame is rendered with the highest possible quality without the calculation
taking longer than 16.7ms. If the calculation exceeds that number and triple
buffering is not enabled in the NVIDIA Control Panel, a frame will be missed,
causing a &#8220;stutter&#8221; in the animation. This stuttering is very visible due to the
even movement of the animation, and it significantly detracts from the quality
of the final presentation. If triple buffering has been enabled, stuttering will
only occur when a delay equivalent to the rendering time for one frame has been
accumulated over time.</p>
<p>The player can display timing information during playback to make configuration
easier. See the <strong>timers</strong> setting below.</p>
<p>A setting can be set to its default value by prepending it with a hash mark
(&#8220;#&#8221;).</p>

<p><strong>timers</strong>: Show timers for the various CUDA kernels that perform the
calculations. The timers are rendered as horizontal bars. A red notch indicates
the time available to calculate and render a single frame. Black marks indicate
lowest, average and highest values for each timer.</p>
<p>It takes some time to render the timers themselves and by design, this rendering
time is not included in the timers. This is so that the parameters can be fine
tuned as if the timers were not being displayed (since the timers will not be
displayed during regular playback). A result of this is that while the timers
are being displayed, the player may be missing frames (causing stuttering) while
still showing a <em>total</em> timer that is below the time limit designated by the red
notch. In that case, the stuttering should go away when the timers are turned
off for regular playback.</p>

<p><strong>vsync</strong>: Synchronize drawing with the monitor refresh. Turning this on causes
the track to run at an even pace and removes tearing. Tearing shows as
horizontal discontinuities in the image, where two parts of the image don&#8217;t
quite match up.</p>
<p>When vsync is on, this app can benefit significantly from triple buffering. If
there was a standard way to request triple buffering, this app would use that
but, unfortunately, there isn&#8217;t. To get triple buffering, enable it in the
NVIDIA Control Panel. When enabled there, any OpenGL app that requests double
buffering automatically gets triple buffering.</p>
<p>The advantage of triple buffering is that the calculations never have to wait.
Say the app is able to calculate frames fast enough to render at 59 FPS and the
monitor runs at 60 FPS. With double buffering, the actual frame rate will be 30
FPS. With triple buffering, the actual frame rate will be 59 FPS.</p>

<p><strong>vsync interval</strong>: Configure the frame rate to be a fraction of the monitor&#8217;s
refresh rate. This sets the frame rate to M/N where M is the monitor&#8217;s refresh
rate and N is the number set in this configuration setting. For instance, with a
monitor running at 60FPS, setting this number to 3 causes a frame rate of
60/3FPS = 20FPS. The purpose of this setting is to enable rendering of tracks
that are more complex (higher bailout value, higher supersampling values, etc)
than the graphics card can handle at full frame rate, by reducing the frame
rate.</p>
<p>Note: Graphics driver issues may cause this parameter to cause stuttering even
when there are no missed frames (when set to a value other than 1).</p>

<p id="screen-width-and-height"><strong>screen width and height</strong>: Sets the display resolution of the track. It is
recommended that these be set to match the physical resolution of the screen.
Any resolution that is supported by the graphics card and monitor can be
specified.</p>
<p>These settings can be used for playing back tracks in full screen with cards
that would otherwise not be able to play them. For instance, if the screen
resolution is 1920x1080, the workload can be reduced to a quarter by setting a
resolution of 960x540. Of course, the result is a blurry image. It may be
preferable to show the player in a window instead, by turning off the

</div>
<p><strong>zoom step</strong>: Sets the difference in zoom level between each frame in the
animation and thus the speed at which one is zooming into the fractal while the
track is being rendered.</p>
<p>When a fractal is rendered in the traditional way, rendering speed and rendering
resolution are closely related. The higher the resolution, the longer the
rendering takes. When a fractal is rendered based on a log scale map, this speed
vs. resolution trade-off is still present but exposed in a different way.
Rendering speed becomes equivalent to rate of zoom. A higher rate of zoom then
causes reduced resolution. However, the reduction in resolution is not uniform
over the entire screen. Instead, the resolution is reduced along imaginary lines
drawn from the center of the screen and towards its edges. A high zoom speed
will cause low resolution that is most apparent towards the outer edges of the
screen.</p>
<p>Since a track specifies a lowest zoom, this setting affects how long it takes
to play back a track. A slow zoom will cause the track to take longer to play
back (which also means that more frames are rendered for each track).</p>
<p>Other steps can be specified &#8211; they are not limited to the provided
examples. However, hardware limitations do impose boundaries on these values.</p>

</div>
<p><strong>transform_ss_x and transform_ss_y</strong>: Specify supersampling anti-aliasing
(SSAA) parameters for the log scale transform. If these are set to values higher
than 1, each pixel that is drawn on screen becomes the average of a higher
number of actually calculated pixels. To get the number of calculated pixels per
displayed pixel, multiply the two transform_ss numbers. For instance, setting
both values to 3 gives 9xSSAA.</p>
<p>3x3 gives significantly better quality than 2x2. It seems like the two odd
numbers help reduce moire patterns created in the log scale transform.</p>
<p>Specify, together with the display resolution, how many fractal values that are
calculated per frame.</p>
<p>Recommended (if your graphics card can handle it): 3x3</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="n">transform_ss_x</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">3</span>
<span class="n">transform_ss_y</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">3</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p><strong>fractal_box_ss</strong>: Specify supersampling anti-aliasing (SSAA) parameters for
the fractal boxes. This parameter specifies supersampling performed on the
fractal escape times. Setting this to a value higher than 1 causes multiple
escape times to be calculated and the values stored in the the fractal boxes
become averages of these values. See the description for <strong>boxes per frame</strong> for
more information on this parameter.</p>
<p>The cost of increasing this parameter may not be linear. For instance, with a
screen size of 1920x1080, the size of a fractal box is 2 * 1920 + 2 * 1080 =
6000 escape times. This again causes 6000 threads to be launched on the GPU. A
GTX 570 has 480 cores, which gives 12.5 threads per core. This is not enough to
hide computational latency, even when the cores are running double precision
calculations (see the <a class="reference internal" href="#single-precision">single precision</a> setting). The result is that it
may be possible to increase this value without any apparent cost. Unfortunately,
the improvement in rendering quality is also fairly marginal.</p>
<p>In general, if it is found that fractal_box_ss does increase kernel time, it is
better to add <a class="reference internal" href="#boxes-per-frame">boxes per frame</a> than extra fractal box supersampling.
The two options increase the number of required calculations in the same way.
For instance, increasing fractal_box_ss from 1 to 2 doubles the number of
Mandelbrot escape times that must be calculated, and so does increasing boxes
per frame from 1 to 2.</p>

automatically to compensate. Recommended: As many as your graphics card can
handle.</p>

</div>
<p><strong>bailout</strong>: A higher bailout value enhances detail in the fractal. However, a
higher bailout values also increases the fractal calculation time and makes it
less likely that the track can be rendered in realtime.</p>
<p>Setting this value overrides the bailout value that is embedded in the track
itself and which was set by the person who created the track. Overriding the
bailout value is not recommended because it causes a shift in the color ranges
that will usually cause the details that the palette was designed to expose to
no longer appear.</p>
<p>The main use for this parameter is to specify a bailout value that is lower
than the ones recorded in the tracks if your graphics card is not fast enough
to render the tracks with their original bailout values.</p>
<p>Normal range: 100 - 10000.</p>

<h3>Performance<a class="headerlink" href="#performance" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>This figure shows kernel execution times in microseconds for two frames rendered
in the player with 1920x1080 display resolution, 9xSSAA (supersampling), bailout
2000, 3 fractal boxes per frame and escape times calculated with double
precision. As can be observed, the transform takes ~8000us, which is half of the
available time when rendering at 60 FPS. Each of the fractal boxes take ~1400us,
4200us total. Leaving around 4400us for the other kernels, overhead and safety
margin, to meet the 60 FPS deadline.</p>

</div>
<p>The two main tasks performed by the player, Mandelbrot escape time calculations
and log scale transforms are both tasks to which the graphics card is ideally
suited. Both consist of large blocks of calculations that are completely
independent of each other and which access memory consecutively. Also, there is
no need for further processing of the data by the CPU so CUDA to OpenGL interop
is used to display the rendered data without it leaving the graphics card.</p>
<p>Performance is good on the GTX 570. In the log scale transform kernel,
instruction throughput is 1.6 instructions per clock out of a possible 2.0 (82%)
and active warps is 41 of 48 (85%). One of of the instructions in the kernel is
a log(), traditionally a very slow instruction. Though, even though the card is
running the kernel at a rate that is close to theoretical maximum, there is
performance to be gained by reducing the number of operations in the kernel in
the following ways:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Factor the 4-way section selection code out of the transform kernel and, on
Fermi (GTX 4xx), run 4 kernels at the same time by using the new ability to
keep multiple kernels in flight at the same time.</li>
<li>Thread counts are low in the escape time calculations. When calculating
multiple boxes per frame or supersampling escape times, those kernels could be
run concurrently on Fermi, which should allow better device utilization.</li>
<li>The supersampling used in the log scale transform is implemented in a
simplistic way. The transform kernel writes unreduced data out to global
memory and a second kernel reads that data in, reduces it and writes it back
out. This should be combined to a single kernel that performs the reduction
using shared memory. Also, the kernel that reduces the data uses one thread
per reduced value instead of one thread per unreduced value.</li>

<div class="section" id="moire-pattern">
<h4>Moiré pattern<a class="headerlink" href="#moire-pattern" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>The main factor that reduces rendering quality in the player is a Moiré pattern
that is visible when rendering certain combinations of fractal data and
palettes. The pattern is created in the log scale transform. Using supersampling
in the transform (an option that is available in the player and enabled by
default) helps but does not completely remove the Moiré pattern. The app uses
linear interpolation when sampling from the fractal box buffer, where the base
data for the log scale transform resides. I am puzzled as to why this does not
remove the Moiré pattern. I don&#8217;t yet know if the issue is inherent to the
mathematics used in the transform or if it&#8217;s caused by a bug or a programming
error, such as a misunderstanding on my part on how the pixel data should be
processed and/or rendered. Any insight that anyone can offer on this would be
much appreciated.</p>
<p>Even when the Moiré pattern is not visible, it can produce areas that radiate
out from the center of image in which pixels seem to flicker.</p>
<p>By filling the fractal box buffer with sample data, alternating black and white
pixels, the Moiré pattern is fully exposed, causing a display as follows. When
rendering a regular track, the Moiré pattern appears &#8220;blended in&#8221; with the
fractal image when it is visible.</p>
<p>As can be seen in the image, when the Moiré pattern is visible, it is most
apparent in areas radiating out from the center in 90 and 45 degree angles.</p>

<h4>CUDA / OpenGL interoperability performance<a class="headerlink" href="#cuda-opengl-interoperability-performance" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>This app uses the CUDA / OpenGL interoperability functionality that was
introduced in CUDA 3.0. I have found that when there are two GPUs installed in
the machine, the speed of the interoperability falls dramatically, presumably
because the driver starts copying the objects that are shared between CUDA and
OpenGL back and forth between host and device.</p>

<h4>Track rendering<a class="headerlink" href="#track-rendering" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>Care has been taken to make tracks render in the player just as they appear
when they are being created in the editor. There are however a few factors
which may alter the exact visual match between the two.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>In the editor, the fractal is rendered with uniform resolution across the
entire image. In the player, the resolution diminishes towards the outer
edges of the screen.</li>
<li>During playback, palettes for different tracks fade into each other during
the transitions between tracks to avoid abrupt color changes. This causes the
colors to not appear correctly for a given track during its first and last
part. Note that the when the player is first launched, the starting palette
for the first track includes a fade in of the ending palette for the last
track, just as if the player had cycled through all the tracks already.</li>
<li>The full Mandelbrot set has a large area in the center where the escape times
all go to the bailout value. To lessen the chance of missed frames when
rendering the initial part of a track, the zoom level is automatically
adjusted if the track starts by showing a big part of the full Mandelbrot set.</li>
<li>If the single precision option is turned on, the final part of a track
is not rendered if it requires double precision.</li>
<li>If a track specifies an ending zoom level that can not be rendered with
double precision floating point, that part is automatically skipped.</li>

<h3>Performance<a class="headerlink" href="#id1" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Performance is not very important in the editor. It just needs to be sufficient
to provide fairly painless editing of tracks. However, I took the opportunity
to roll in a few different Mandelbrot calculation methods that I had available
from earlier projects and the app displays the number of gigaflops
attained while running the calculations, so that some benchmarking can be done.</p>
<p>There is also the side effect that the computer on which tracks are created and
edited does not have to be CUDA capable (as opposed to the computer on which the
tracks are played).</p>
<p>The Mandelbrot escape time calculation methods included are:</p>
<p><strong>x86 32 bit float and x86 64/80 bit double</strong>: Straight forward implementation
written in C++, templatized on the floating point type.</p>
<p><strong>SSE2, 4x32 bit floats, C++ with intrinsics</strong>: This implementation was written
by Bjørn Bæverfjord, <a class="reference external" href="http://www.sciencezero.org">www.sciencezero.org</a>. It
calculates 4 escape times simultaneously using packed floats. It is implemented
using SSE2 intrinsics in C++.</p>
<p><strong>SSE2, 2x64 bit doubles, x64 assembly</strong>: This implementation calculates 2
escape times simultaneously using packed doubles in SSE2. It is implemented in
x64 assembly. It is part of an earlier project where I researched how to write
x64 and integrate it with C++ in Visual C++. As part of that project, I also
wrote a <a class="reference external" href="http://www.sciencezero.org/index.php?title=How_to_write_x64_assembly_functions_in_Visual_C%2B%2B">brief x64 assembly tutorial</a>.</p>
<p><strong>CUDA 32 bit float and CUDA 64 bit float</strong>: Straight forward calculation
written in CUDA C, templatized on the floating point type.</p>
<p>The CPU implementations were all parallelized using OpenMP.</p>
<p>An interesting observation that can be made from viewing the different
implementations is the big difference in level of complexity between the CUDA
and the SSE implementations. The SSE implementations had to be written in
assembly (or by using assembly intrinsics). The fact that the number of
iterations in the loop vary for each escape time calculation has to be handled
manually by masking techniques. In addition, the loop must be bracketed by code
that first packs the starting values into XMM registers and unpacks the results
afterwards. In contrast, the CUDA implementation of the escape time calculation
loop looks like the plain C++ implementation. In other words, not only does the
CUDA implementation of the Mandelbrot escape time calculation run much
faster (see <a class="reference internal" href="#benchmark">Benchmark</a>), it also saved a lot of developer time.</p>
<div class="section" id="benchmark">
<h4>Benchmark<a class="headerlink" href="#benchmark" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>Here is a benchmark performed on my computer, an 8 core Xeon E5504 &#8220;Gainestown&#8221;
2.0GHz machine with a GTX 570 graphics card at 1.5GHz.</p>
<p>Characteristic of the Mandelbrot escape time calculation: The calculation is
always purely compute bound. The loop consists of 14 floating point operations,
a branch and an integer subtraction and test for zero. In this test, the loop
was run 10,000 times for approximately 24,000,000 values. There is almost no
I/O. Input is 2 floating point values, output is one integer value.</p>
<p>The editor was set up with 25xSSAA, bailout was set to 10,000 and the window
was maximized. A zoom was then performed into the center of the Mandelbrot set,
where all escape times hit the bailout value.</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre>x86 double     13 gflops
x86 float      14 gflops
SSE2 double    22 gflops
SSE2 float     56 gflops
CUDA double   137 gflops
CUDA float    528 gflops
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>As mentioned earlier, the CPU implementations were parallelized using OpenMP, so
the CPU implementations use all available cores. Calculations were verified to
scale linearly with core count. This was expected as the calculations are
compute bound and have no interdependencies.</p>
<p>Observations:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Single precision on GTX 570 at 1.5GHz is 9x faster than 8 Gainestown cores at
2.0GHz. It would be 19x faster on a similar quad core machine.</li>
<li>Similarly, double precision is 6x faster.</li>
<li>The difference between single and double precision on CUDA is only 4x even
though the Fermi GF110 chip on the GTX 570 card has been artificially limited
to double precision floating point performance 1/8th that of single precision.
This indicates that the single precision implementation can be improved.</li>
<li>Also relevant is the performance difference between x86 float and CUDA float,
where CUDA float is 38x faster (75x on a quad core machine). This comparison
is relevant because it compares two implementations in which about the same
amount of developer effort was put.</li>

<ul class="simple">
<li>Automatically adjust the interpolated spatial palettes so that they slice in
the same way as the keys.</li>
<li>Store normalized escape times in the fractal boxes.</li>
<li>Look at the &#8220;parallel reduction&#8221; and &#8220;threadFenceReduction&#8221; SDK examples for
information on how to do the supersampling in a single kernel. Also read the
whitepaper for reduction.</li>
<li>It&#8217;s possible to minimize the difference in rendered result when bailout is
forced to a lower value than what&#8217;s in the track by scaling the color range
like it would be scaled for the original value. For bailout that is forced to
a higher value, there are no colors, but the best option would probably be to
just mirror back.</li>
