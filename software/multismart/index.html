<h1>Multismart &#8211; Multipart Archive Tool<a class="headerlink" href="#multismart-multipart-archive-tool" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>Multismart is primarily a tool that groups files. Instead of displaying long
lists of related files like you see in a regular file view, Multismart groups
the files and displays the groups along with statistics about the groups.</p>
<p>Multismart integrates the display of disk files, RAR archives, PAR files, SFV
files, Descript.ion files and calculated information to show you a complete
overview of the state of all your archives.</p>
<div class="section" id="quick-start">
<h2>Quick Start<a class="headerlink" href="#quick-start" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>This application should be fairly intuitive, but there are some details you need
to know before you start. I&#8217;ll try to keep this short. Read the Features in
Detail section below if you would like to know more.</p>
<div class="section" id="installing-and-starting-the-application">
<h3>Installing and Starting the Application<a class="headerlink" href="#installing-and-starting-the-application" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Starting the application is as easy as unzipping the file and starting the
application. No installation is necessary. The application is a single
executable file. It touches only the folders you monitor and it creates one key
in the registry where it stores your settings.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="monitoring-folders">
<h3>Monitoring Folders<a class="headerlink" href="#monitoring-folders" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>After you point Multismart to a folder that contains multipart archives, the
application will monitor that folder. You will see one or more lines of text in
Multismart&#8217;s main window. Each line is an &#8220;item&#8221;. An item can be a real file
that exists on disk, a file that Multismart learned about by reading another
file or a piece of calculated information. The &#8220;Show existing and missing&#8221; check
boxes turn on display of existing files and missing files. When both of these
are turned off you see only archive items. Each archive item displays statistics
about one distinct archive that exists in part or in whole on your hard drive.
It is in this mode that Multismart is most useful. When you turn on display of
existing and or missing files you clutter up the display without receiving much
more information.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="interpreting-the-display">
<h3>Interpreting the display<a class="headerlink" href="#interpreting-the-display" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>For this short description, I will focus on archive items. An archive item is in
one of three states marked by the names &#8220;archive&#8221;, &#8220;archive pending&#8221; and
&#8220;archive guess&#8221; in the Type column. When Multismart first reads the monitored
folder, it only finds filenames and file sizes. Multismart is able to make a
number of educated guesses about your archives from this information alone, but
they are still only guesses. In particular, there may be undetected errors in
the archive parts and the filenames may be misleading as to which archives the
parts belong to. If checksum information exists for an archive in the form of
PAR or SFV files, the archive item is in the state of &#8220;archive pending&#8221; until
Multismart has verified the checksums of all the parts, after which the state
changes to &#8220;archive&#8221;. If no checksum information exists, the archive item is
displayed as &#8220;archive guess&#8221; and left at that.</p>
<p>The quickest way to describe how to interpret the information that Multismart
displays is probably to use an example. Imagine that you&#8217;re downloading a
multipart RAR archive called BigArchive that consists of 5 parts (rar, r00, r01,
r02, r03). Here&#8217;s what happens as you get the parts in random order:</p>
<p>Lets say the first archive part you get is BigArchive.r02. Seeing this file
alone, Multismart knows there&#8217;s an archive called BigArchive that has at least 4
parts (rar, r00, r01, r02). It will then display an archive guess item saying
&#8220;size ok, have 1 of 4 or more parts&#8221;. (<strong>archive guess, size ok, 1 / 4+</strong>). It&#8217;s
the best it can do at this point.</p>
<p>Adding BigArchive.r03: The last file in an archive is almost always shorter than
the other files. When Multismart sees that this file is shorter than
BigArchive.r02, it makes a guess that r03 is the last part and alters the
archive guess item to say &#8220;size ok, have 2 of 5 parts&#8221;. (<strong>archive guess, size
ok, 2 / 5</strong>).</p>
<p>Adding BigArchive.rar but it is truncated by a download error: Multismart sees
that the new part is shorter than expected and adds a size error to the display.
(<strong>archive guess, size error: 1, 2 / 5</strong>). As you see, the part with the size
error doesn&#8217;t count towards the number of parts.</p>
<p>Adding a parity file for the archive, say BigArchive.p02: Multismart no longer
has to make guesses on the archive, and it will display an archive pending item
until it is done calculating checksums and verifying all files in the archive.
It will then display an archive item saying that two files are missing or have
checksum errors and that one of those errors is being covered by a parity file.
(<strong>archive, md5 error: 1, 3 / 5 (1 / 1)</strong>). Read about parity archives below if
you don&#8217;t undertand this. The number in parentheses shows that 1 out of 1
available parity files were used for coming up with the total of 3 / 5 parts
present.</p>
<p>Adding another parity archive and archive part, say BigArchive.p03 and
BigArchive.r00: The archive is now complete because the two parity archives can
be used for fixing one truncated file (BigArchive.rar) and one missing file
(BigArchive.r01). This is displayed as <strong>archive, complete, 5 / 5 (2 / 2)</strong>.
Multismart will then automatically fix the archive the next time you click the
par button. After this, the par files are deleted, and the archive displays
simply as <strong>archive, complete, 5 / 5</strong>.</p>
</div>

<div class="section" id="caution-and-tips">
<h2>Caution and Tips<a class="headerlink" href="#caution-and-tips" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Like all powerful tools, this one can do some serious damage if you don&#8217;t use it
right. Tips for the beginner are:</p>
<p>When performing Delete operations, carefully look at the list of actual files in
the confirmation dialog to see what you are deleting. If you are unsure how a
specific file ended up in the delete list, try selecting items one at a time and
click Delete to see which of them imply deleting the file in question.</p>
<p>If you ever wonder how Multismart came up with a specific piece of information,
turning on display of existing and missing files may help.</p>
<p>If you don&#8217;t understand how a specific combination of files resulted in what is
being displayed, you can point Multismart to an empty folder, and move files in
and out of that folder one at a time while refreshing the display after each
move. You&#8217;ll then see exactly what&#8217;s going on.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="what-is-a-parity-archive">
<h2>What is a Parity Archive?<a class="headerlink" href="#what-is-a-parity-archive" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Parity archives are files with an extension of .Pxx (P01, P02 etc). They protect
a set of files by storing redundant information derived from the files in the
set. The redundant information can be used to restore broken and missing files
in the protected set of files. Think of a parity archive as a &#8220;wildcard&#8221; file &#8211;
it will replace any one broken file in the set. Any two parity archives will
replace any two broken files and so on.</p>
<p>How does it work? Consider this simple example: Say you have 4 files, each
storing a single number. Let&#8217;s choose the random numbers 3, 4, 9 and 5. You now
create a file containing the sum of all the numbers, which is 21. This file is
the &#8220;parity archive&#8221;. If you now lose a random file of the 4 original files, say
file 3, you can find the lost number by taking the number stored in the parity
archive and subtracting the numbers stored in all the files you do have: 21 - 3
- 4 - 5 = 9.</p>
<p>Parity archives let you use any number of random parity files generated for a
set to fix the same number of random broken files in the set and this makes the
math very complicated, but you get the idea. Note that because of a mathematical
weakness in the PAR system there are some combinations of files that can not be
restored. These combinations are very rare though.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="limitations">
<h2>Limitations<a class="headerlink" href="#limitations" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Only RAR archives are supported. The first archive part must be &#8221;.RAR&#8221;, not
&#8221;.EXE&#8221;.</p>
<p>Multismart assumes that a set of PAR parents cover exactly one archive. It will
not display information about archives correctly if the archives are covered
only in part by a PAR set, or one PAR set covers more than one archive.</p>
<p>Multismart relies almost entirely on filenames for grouping files into the
archives they are part of. So if you, for some weird reason, have files that
have the exact same names but are parts of different archives, that will confuse
Multismart.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="multismart-features-in-detail">
<h2>Multismart Features in Detail<a class="headerlink" href="#multismart-features-in-detail" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>In the following, I use the terms &#8220;PAR/SFV parent&#8221; and &#8220;PAR/SFV child&#8221;. A
PAR/SFV parent is a file with the extension of .SFV, PAR, Pxx or Qxx where xx is
a number between 00 and 99. The files contain lists of files and corresponding
checksums. Pxx and Qxx files also contain recovery data &#8211; more about that later.
A PAR/SFV child is a file that is listed in one of these files. A PAR set is a
collection of PAR parents that all have the same children and those children.</p>
<div class="section" id="monitored-folder-overview">
<h3>Monitored folder overview<a class="headerlink" href="#monitored-folder-overview" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Without running any additional functions you can check which archives you have,
how many parts you have and how many parts are missing in each archive, in which
time period the archive parts were created on disk, if any parts of an archive
failed MD5/CRC32 (if the archive has a PAR/SFV parent), the size status of each
archive (if the archive does not have a PAR/SFV parent), Descript.ion
information for the first existing archive part and which archives have PAR/SFV
parents.</p>
<p>By turning on &#8220;show existing files&#8221; you can also read the Descript.ion
information for each existing part of the archive, check the MD5/CRC32 status
for each file (if the archive has a PAR/SFV parent), delete individual archive
parts (for instance those with MD5/CRC32 errors) and see other files you have in
your monitored folder.</p>
<p>By turning on &#8220;show missing files&#8221; you will also find details about all PAR/SFV
children that don&#8217;t exist in your monitored folder and all files that don&#8217;t
exist in the monitored folder or in any PAR/SFV parents but still need to be
present to complete an archive (gaps).</p>

<p>The guestimated numbers may or may not have a &#8220;+&#8221; behind them. If they don&#8217;t
have a &#8220;+&#8221;, that means that the archive has a PAR/SFV parent and so Multismart
can be reasonably certain that the exact number of parts in the archive is
known. If there is a &#8220;+&#8221;, there were no PAR/SFV parents and a guess was made
based on the same logic as described in the &#8220;complete?&#8221; section above.</p>

<h3>PAR Resolver<a class="headerlink" href="#par-resolver" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Clicking the &#8220;PAR&#8221; button starts the PAR Resolver which attempts to fix all
known archives that have errors. The PAR Resolver searches each archive for
broken files. If it finds any broken files, it searches for healthy PAR parents
to use for fixing those files. If enough PAR parents are found, an attempt is
made to fix the archive. If, for any reason at all, the attempt fails, all
involved files are left exactly as they were. If on the other hand, fixing the
archive is successful, as verified by thoroughly checking all involved files
using MD5 checksums, the PAR parents are deleted as they no longer have any
value.</p>
<p>This function ignores names of files. It works exclusively based on file MD5
checksums, eliminating the possibility that any error is made because of mangled
filenames or filename collisions. This approach maximizes the chance that an
archive is fixed because all relevant files will be used no matter what their
filenames are. After an archive has been completely fixed, all files in the
archive are renamed to match the names of the files as they are listed in the
PAR parents. This maximizes the chance that you will be able to successfully
extract the archive.</p>
<p>Note: Any file that has not yet been MD5/CRC32&#8217;ed is effectively invisible to
this function. So, to fix as many archives as possible, use this function after
all files have been MD5/CRC32&#8217;ed.</p>

<h3>Duplicate Cleanup and Fixing Archives<a class="headerlink" href="#duplicate-cleanup-and-fixing-archives" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Clicking the &#8220;Dup&#8221; button starts the duplicate cleanup process. This function
automates fixing archives by replacing original broken files with duplicate
intact files. It also automatically deletes duplicates of intact original files.</p>
<p>Multismart&#8217;s Dup function works on the assumption that all of the following
files are the same file:</p>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">BigArchive.r03</div>
<div class="line">BigArchive-0001.r03</div>
<div class="line">BigArchive-0002.r03</div>

<div class="line">Copy of BigArchive.r03</div>
<div class="line">Copy (2) of BigArchive.r03</div>
</div>
<p>As you see, I&#8217;m attempting to cover any automatic renaming scheme that may have
been applied to your files. If, for some reason, you have archives with names
like above that are actually different archives, you should not use this
function.</p>
<div class="section" id="the-basic-rules-for-renaming-and-deleting-files">
<h4>The basic rules for renaming and deleting files<a class="headerlink" href="#the-basic-rules-for-renaming-and-deleting-files" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>The best way to describe what Dup does is probably by examples:</p>
<p>If BigArchive.r03 has the correct size, or better, a correct MD5/CRC32 checksum
(verified by a PAR/SFV parent), all other permutations of BigArchive.r03 will be
deleted (as specified above).</p>
<p>If BigArchive.r03 has an incorrect size or an incorrect MD5/CRC32 checksum
(again as verified by a PAR/SFV parent), all permutations of BigArchive.r03 will
be searched for one that matches the required size or MD5/CRC32. If one is
found, the original BigArchive.r03 file is replaced with the found file, and all
other BigArchive.r03 files are deleted.</p>
<p>Note: To avoid that files such as newyears-1998.r03 confuse the function, it is
a requirement that the two first digits of the -nnnn sequence are 00. This will
only be a problem if you have more than 100 duplicates of a file.</p>

<div class="section" id="delete">
<h4>Delete<a class="headerlink" href="#delete" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>

entire archive. Deleting &#8220;PAR only&#8221;, &#8220;SFV only&#8221; or &#8220;gap&#8221; items is not possible
since they don&#8217;t exist on disk. These items will disappear automatically when
the actual files that they display information about are deleted.</p>
<p>After clicking <em>Delete</em>, a confirmation dialog will appear. The dialog shows you
exactly which files will be deleted if you complete the function.</p>

<p>Copy a list of filenames to the Clipboard. If you have made a selection that
implicitly selects more than one type of items, a dialog box will appear where
you can specify what kind of items you would like to include in your list.
Existing files are files that are actually present in your monitored folder and
virtual files are files that are missing in your monitored folder but which
Multismart thinks are needed for creating complete archives.</p>

<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">BigArchive r03-r05, r10</div>
<div class="line">AnotherArhive.r08</div>
</div>
<p><em>Missing</em> automatically excludes files that exist in your monitored folder, even
if they are in your selection.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="refresh">
<h4>Refresh<a class="headerlink" href="#refresh" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>When you first open a folder and then each time you click the Refresh button,
the folder is scanned for new files, and special files are opened and scanned.
This can be a lengthy process if you have a huge amount of files in the folder.
After the folder is scanned, MD5/CRC32 calculations of any new files are
started. This can take a very long time, but you may work with the application
during this process. Be aware though that any uncalculated files are invisible
to all PAR functions. So, to increase the chance that PAR functions succeed,
wait until all MD5/CRC32 calculations are finished before running them.</p>
<p>To avoid hard drive trashing, simultaneous MD5/CRC32 calculations of different
folders on the same drive are queued and executed consecutively while
calculations of folders on different drives are executed concurrently.</p>

database from growing too big, Multismart also keeps track of how much unused

<p>File MD5/CRC32 performance in Multismart should equal or exceed that of the
applications mentioned above because it uses the fastest disk access method
provided by Windows.</p>
<p>Note that because MD5/CRC32 is a lengthy process; Multismart runs the MD5/CRC32
processes on a priority that is slightly lower than default. There is a
potential disadvantage in that if you run less &#8220;courteous&#8221; applications that
perform lengthy operations at higher priorities, Multismart will wait until
these are done before doing work itself. The advantage is that you will see very
little impact on the usability of your computer while the MD5/CRC32 process
runs.</p>

<p>Multismart currently considers files with MD5/CRC32 errors absent even though it
might be possible to recover the file if it is a RAR part that was created with
the &#8220;recovery&#8221; option. The best way for Multismart to deal with such RAR parts
would probably be to detect if they were created with a recovery option and then
try to recover it, but for now, that is not implemented.</p>

<div class="section" id="the-file-database-multismart">
<h3>The file database, .Multismart<a class="headerlink" href="#the-file-database-multismart" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Multismart maintains a database of file MD5s and CRCs, so that it doesn&#8217;t have
to MD5/CRC32 the same file several times. Multismart also stores information
such as last modified date and size of all existing files in this database. This
prevents Multismart from making any mistakes if you change or overwrite files.
The name of the database file is .Multismart and it is stored in the monitored
folder. It you delete this file while Multismart is running, Multismart will
automatically restore it, but if you delete it when Multismart is not running,
Multismart has to MD5/CRC32 all your files again before it can display full
information about the archives the next time you start it.</p>

<div class="section" id="uninstall">
<h2>Uninstall<a class="headerlink" href="#uninstall" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>

</div>
<div class="section" id="multiple-instances">
<h2>Multiple instances<a class="headerlink" href="#multiple-instances" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>It should not be necessary to run multiple instances of Multismart because you
can monitor as many folders as you like with a single instance of the program.
However, you can run multiple instances of Multismart as long as you point them
to different monitored folders. If you try to run two or more instances of
Multismart pointing to the same monitored folder you may get inconsistent
results as instances bicker over the data in the database files (.Multismart and
Descript.ion).</p>
<p>Only the settings from the last instance you close will be retained because
instances will share the Registry key.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="double-selections">
<h2>&#8220;Double&#8221; selections<a class="headerlink" href="#double-selections" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>If you select both a archive item and one or more corresponding archive parts
that exist on disk, you have essentially selected some items multiple times
because archive items are virtual items and refer directly to the real items.
Deleting this selection will cause the real items to be deleted twice as hard &#8211;
just kidding :)</p>
<p>The rule is that Multismart will always try to process as many files as possible
when you select files both implicitly (through selecting an archive item or a
PAR/SFV parent) and explicitly (through select corresponding archive parts or
PAR/SFV children) at the same time.</p>

<h2>Finding how many parts of which a RAR archive consists<a class="headerlink" href="#finding-how-many-parts-of-which-a-rar-archive-consists" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The RAR archive format does not provide a way to find directly how many parts
make up a given RAR archive. Multismart deals with this problem in the following
way.</p>
<div class="section" id="without-a-par-sfv-parent">
<h3>Without a PAR/SFV parent<a class="headerlink" href="#without-a-par-sfv-parent" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Multismart knows that RAR archives consist of many parts. If Multismart sees the
following two files:</p>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">BigArchive.r05</div>
<div class="line">BigArchive.r07</div>
</div>
<p>it knows that there is a RAR archive called &#8220;BigArchive&#8221; that has at least 9
parts (RAR, r00 - r07) where two parts are present and the rest are missing. It
looks at the size of the last known file (r07 in this case) and compares it to
the size of the other files in the archive. If the file is smaller, chances are
that it is the last file of the archive. If the file is the same size, there are
probably files beyond r07 but there is no good way for Multismart to find out
how many.</p>

<div class="section" id="with-an-par-sfv-parent">
<h3>With an PAR/SFV parent<a class="headerlink" href="#with-an-par-sfv-parent" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>If there is a PAR/SFV parent, Multismart uses it to find out how many parts an
archive consists of. It will also use the checksums in the SFV file to check if
there are checksum errors in the corresponding files.</p>
</div>

<h2>Deciding whether or not to delete the archive<a class="headerlink" href="#deciding-whether-or-not-to-delete-the-archive" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Multismart keeps track of the following key information about an archive:</p>
<p>How many days since the first time and the last time a part of the archive was
encountered and the number of existing and missing parts of an archive.</p>
<p>Multismart then compares these values with values you supply to find out if a
particular archive should be selected for deletion. For instance, you might say
that archives where there&#8217;s more than 5 missing parts and the last part was
encountered more than 2 days ago should be marked.</p>
<p>If a few new parts of the now deleted archive appear later, they will
automatically be marked for deletion when you run the function with the same
criteria again.</p>
