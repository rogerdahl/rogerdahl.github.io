<h1>µC with 16x16 LED Matrix Display<a class="headerlink" href="#c-with-16x16-led-matrix-display" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>This is a project I did to familiarize myself with current, sophisticated
microcontrollers available for only a few dollars. The project implements a
small device with a 16x16 LED matrix display powered by a µC. The device can be
used for running realtime embedded applications that process and display
information.</p>
<p>I start out by describing how to build the device. I then go on to include
various background information such as how I arrived at the set of components
that was used and various practical notes about embedded development and the
physical aspects of putting together a circuit on breadboard.</p>
<div class="section" id="the-device">
<h2>The device<a class="headerlink" href="#the-device" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>This video shows the device running a zoom into the Mandelbrot set. This is in
keeping with a long standing tradition established among my friends and myself
where rendering the Mandelbrot is implemented as the initial &#8220;Hello World&#8221;
application on a new platform. As the ARM Cortex-M3 core that is used in the
STM32L does not have floating point, I used a highly optimized fixed point
algorithm, kindly provided by Bjørn Bæverfjord, <a class="reference external" href="http://www.sciencezero.org">www.sciencezero.org</a>.</p>

<div class="section" id="theory-of-operation">
<h2>Theory of operation<a class="headerlink" href="#theory-of-operation" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>A single row of 16 LEDs is active at any given time. The µC continously changes
the active row by enabling a new output on the high side drivers and disabling
the previous one. Each time a new row is activated, the low side driver is
updated with new data that designates how long each of the LEDs in that row
should be on, from 0 to 100% with a resolution of 1024 steps. Persistence of
vision creates the illusion that all LEDs on the display are active at the same
time.</p>

<p>Among the advantages to this selection are low component count and fairly low
price. See &lt;selecting components&gt; for things I considered and learned when
searching for components.</p>
<p>The LED display itself is not included because I already had that. I soldered
the display together a long, <em>long</em> time ago.</p>

<p>There&#8217;s not much point in providing full schematics for this design as it is
so simple. Instead, refer to the pictures and the following table.</p>
<p>The primary factor when selecting IO pins was their locations. I wanted as many
connections as possible to use the traces on the breadboard, without having to
add wires. Other factors were the Discovery board usage of the pins, the
STM32 defaults for the pins and their 5V tolerance.</p>

<h2>Selecting the components<a class="headerlink" href="#selecting-the-components" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Common to the selection of all the components was that I was limited to DIP
components (0.1&#8221;, through hole). I don&#8217;t have the equipment to deal with SMD or
BGA. (I have since learned that there are convenient SMD adapter boards
available).</p>
<div class="section" id="c">
<h3>µC<a class="headerlink" href="#c" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>I did not want to use any of the 8 bit controllers, as it seems to me that they
are becoming irrelevant. Also, I&#8217;m a fan of the ARM architecture, and
STMicroelectronics makes ARM based microcontrollers easy to work with for
amateurs by providing amazingly inexpensive prototyping boards called STM32
Discovery boards (~$10 as of Q1, 2012). So the choice quickly came down to the
STM32L, STM32VL or STM32F4 Discovery board. Of these, I ruled out the F4 because
it is slightly more expensive ($16) and because I didn&#8217;t need the extra
processing power. Of the two remaining ones, the STM32L Discovery board includes
an LCD display, which seemed like it would be really useful for debugging, so I
went with it.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="high-side-driver">
<h3>High side driver<a class="headerlink" href="#high-side-driver" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>I selected the TLC59213 as the high side driver for the following reasons:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>I wanted to run the design off of a single 5V supply. The TLC59213 accepts
input levels down to 2V, even when running off of a 5V supply. So it can
source around 4.4V on each of its output lines based on 3.3V signals from the
STM32, which leaves a comfortable margin for the voltage drop over the LEDs
and over the low side driver.</li>
<li>A single row of LEDs uses 16 x 20mA = 320mA. The TLC59213 is able to drive
that on a single pin, with good headroom. There are severe restrictions to
that driving capability but they are not relevant while the display is
running. See &lt;thoughts on circuit safety&gt; for more information on this.</li>
</ul>
<div class="section" id="other-options-considered-for-high-side">
<h4>Other options considered for high side<a class="headerlink" href="#other-options-considered-for-high-side" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p><strong>UDN2981, UDN2982, MIC2981, MIC2982</strong>: For the purposes of this project, these
are identical to each other and they would all have worked for this project.
Their specs are also very similar to the TLC59213 &#8211; they are all Darlington
arrays. Depending on the manufacturer (the UDN298x designators are used by
several manufacturers), the specs may be slightly inferior to the TLC59213. For
this project, the important spec is the driving capability when only one pin is
on at a 1/16 duty cycle. The TLC59213 costs about the same, has equivalent or
better specificatons and adds latches and a facility to clear all outputs to the
basic design of these driver arrays. I wanted the ability to clear the output
signals for &lt;safety&gt;. I did not end up using the latches, but they can be used
for multiplexing IO pins on the STM32, so that fewer pins are needed.</p>
<p><strong>UDN2987</strong>: The &#8216;7 adds over-current protection to the basic Darlington array
design. It is a nice safety feature, but the chip wasn&#8217;t carried by the
suppliers I checked.</p>
<p><strong>LMD18400</strong>: This chip has very impressive specs. It contains MOSFET power
switches, so it can switch high currents with very low ON resistance. However it
is very expensive and would have been overkill for this project.</p>
<p><strong>16 discrete &#8220;logic level&#8221; P-channel MOSFETs, such as IRFD9120</strong>: Not having
used Darlington arrays before, I thought that these would develop significant
heat and have a voltage drop that might leave the design marginal on a 5V
supply. Neither turned out to be the case. The TLC59213s run cool and even after
the voltage drop over the high side drivers and the LEDs, the constant current
driver on the low side still has enough to work with. Not knowing this, I first
unsuccessfully searched for reasonably priced high side driver arrays with
MOSFET outputs. Not finding any good options for arrays, I researched the option
of using 16 discrete MOSFETs. I found that even for &#8220;logic level&#8221; MOSFETs, 3.3V
switching voltage is too low to bring them into their saturated regions (they
don&#8217;t turn on fully). This means that there is little, if any, benefit to using
MOSFET / DMOS when driving them with 3.3V, such as that provided by the GPIO
pins on the STM32 &#8211; which is probably why I was unable to find good options for
such drivers for this design in the first place.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="low-side-driver">
<h3>Low side driver<a class="headerlink" href="#low-side-driver" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>I selected the TLC5941 as the low side driver for the following reasons:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>It is a constant current driver. The constant current drivers automatically
compensate for differences in the resistance in the individual LEDs and
differences between the driving capabilities of each output on the high side,
causing the LEDs to match each other better in brightness.</li>
<li>With constant current drivers, there is no need for external resistors for
each line (16 would be required in this design). Also, because this design
causes three semiconductors to be coupled in series for each LED, each with a
non-linear resistance vs. voltage ratio, it&#8217;s seemed like it would be hard to
calculate the correct resistance without having the parts in hand (in
particular because I did not have the datasheets for the LEDs). With constant
current drivers, I didn&#8217;t have to worry about this.</li>
<li>I had intended on doing grayscale with PWM in firmware. The TLC5941 does
that itself, making the firmware implementation easier and giving the µC more
time to run application logic.</li>
<li>The TLC5941 has dot correction, which can be used to further even out any
differences in brightness between the LEDs. This compensates for different
LEDs having different brightness even given the same current. I&#8217;m currently
not using that functionality.</li>
<li>It controls all 16 columns with just one chip.</li>
<li>It is controlled over a serial bus, so fewer GPIO pins on the STM32 are used
than with plain driver arrays.</li>
<li>As a bonus, it turns out that the constant current drivers are able to handle
all 256 LEDs being on at the same time, which makes the design more resistant
to firmware bugs (see safetly below), than it would have been with plain
Darlington arrays on the low side.</li>

<p><strong>ULN2803</strong>: The ULN2803 Darlington array is a common choice for a low side

<p><strong>16 discrete NPN transistors</strong>: The ULN2803 is essentially 8 Darlington
transistors. In this design, two ULN2803s would have been able to handle the

<h2>Overview of the firmware<a class="headerlink" href="#overview-of-the-firmware" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The STM32L is set up to run on the 16MHz HSI (High Speed Internal) clock. This
is an internal oscillator, factory calibrated to be accurate within 2%. The HSI
is connected to the MCO output pin via a prescaler that is set to 16. This
causes the MCO to output 1MHz which is connected to the GSCLK on the TLC5941.</p>
<p>Also connected to the HSI is an internal timer with its prescaler set to 16.
This causes the timer to be clocked at 1MHz. The timer is set up to trigger an
interrupt when its value reaches 1024, which is also when the TLC5941 has been
clocked 1024 times, which corresponds to the number of grayscale steps that can
be displayed.</p>
<p>Each time the interrupt is triggered, it sets the high side drivers to enable
the next row of LEDs and it writes the grayscale values for the new row to the
low side driver. The number of rows displayed per second is 1MHz / 1024
grayscales = 976. The display has 16 rows, so the refresh rate is 976 / 16 = 61
FPS.</p>
<p>When running in this configuration, the interrupts that drive the display
take up around 2/3 of the total CPU cycles available to the µC. The other 1/3
are available for generating content to display. The STM32L is capable of
running at up to 32MHz, so more cycles can be made available for generating
content by increasing the core frequency from 16 to 32MHz.</p>
<p>Also, the STM32L should be able to drive the display almost entirely without
using CPU cycles by redesigning the firmware to use the SPI peripheral and DMA.</p>

<h3>Odd issue with the MCO clock<a class="headerlink" href="#odd-issue-with-the-mco-clock" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>When I ran the MCO clock any higher than at 1MHz, I got random flickering on the
display. The TLC5941 supports GSCLK up to 30MHz and the distance between the
STM32L and the TLC5941 is short, so the clock should have been able to run much
faster. However, running it on 1MHz and using 1024 levels of gray is pretty much
the same as running on, for instance, 4MHz and using 4096 levels of gray since
even 1024 levels of gray are many more than the human eye can distinguish
between (that number is probably closer to 32 or so). So, I left the MCO clock
at 1MHz and did not investigate the issue further.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="other-details-about-the-design">
<h2>Other details about the design<a class="headerlink" href="#other-details-about-the-design" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>It is important that VCC of the TLC5941 be connected to the EXT_3V pin on the
Discovery board (as indicated in the table above). The TLC5941 requires high
signals to be at least 0.8 VCC. So, even though the TLC5941 can run at 5V, this
requires high signals to be at least 0.8 * 5V = 4.0V, which is higher than the
3.3V signals provided by the STM32. I had missed this in the datasheet and had
at first connected the TLC5941 to the 5V rail. This caused me considerable
grief as some grayscale values would flicker while others were ok, and I was
unable to consistently reproduce results I got with different versions of the
firmware.</p>
<p>VCC on the TLC59213s must be connected to the 5V rail. As all the current for
the LEDs flows through the TLC59213 VCCs, connecting this to the EXT_3V pin on
the Discovery board would break the 3.3V regulator on the Discovery board. The
regulator is designed to supply the STM32L and have around 100mA extra for
external circuitry. The LEDs and the drivers use close to 500mA. Also, with a
3.3V supply, there might not be enough voltage to light up the LEDs. The drop
across the LEDs is around 2.1V when they run at their maximum rated current of
20mA. In addition, there are ~0.6V drops over both the high- and the low side
drivers, which gives a total of 3.3V. So there is nothing to work with for the
constant current outputs on the TLC5941.</p>
<p>If you do your own search for drivers for a LED matrix project, in which both
high side and low side drivers are required, you will find that it&#8217;s easy to
find low side drivers but that high side drivers are (1) rare, (2) expensive and
(3) less efficient. Briefly, this is because electron holes do not move as
easily as electrons do in a semiconductor.</p>
<p>The TLC5941 is a low side driver. It would have made much more sense for it to
be a high side driver. This is becase the TLC5941 will almost always be used
in designs where a single TLC5941 controls multiple rows of LEDs. PNP (high
side) transistors are less efficient at controlling current than NPN (low side)
transistors. Since the TLC5941 is a low side driver that controls 16 LEDs, any
design that uses this chip to control multiple rows is forced to use the less
efficient PNP transistors for sourcing the current for the rows of LEDs. If the
TLC5941 was a high side driver, more efficient NPN transistors could be used on
the low side to sink a full row of 16 LEDs at a time. At the same time, even
though the TLC5941 would then have had to use PNP transistors to source the
current, the impact would have been much lower for that chip, since each line
only has to be able to handle the current for a single LED, not for a whole row
of LEDs.</p>
<p>One is left with the sense that the designers of the chip, knowing this, still
went ahead and made a low side driver to keep the efficiency up and the cost
down for their part, while knowing that it would cause most users to have to use
less efficient and more expensive parts overall.</p>

<div class="section" id="thoughts-on-safety-circuitry">
<h2>Thoughts on safety circuitry<a class="headerlink" href="#thoughts-on-safety-circuitry" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>For any but the very most trivial of embedded projects, one must decide how
resistant the hardware should be to firmware bugs.</p>
<p>A basic example is that a µC might be used for controlling a motor. Turning on
one relay causes the motor to spin in one directon. Turning on another relay
causes the motor to spin in the opposite direction (by reversing the polarity).
Turning on both relays at the same time causes the motor, the power supply or
both to blow up. There are endless possible variations on the theme. In
particular, consider machinery with moving parts, where it is only physically
possible for the machine to move through a concerted set of states, each of
which has a specific configuration of all the moving parts.</p>
<p>Do you create additional safety circuitry such as, in this case of the motor,
using a second relay with more contacts, or do you just write your firmware so
that it doesn&#8217;t switch on both directions at once?</p>
<p>In this project, there are no moving parts, but it is still possible for the µC
to put the hardware into an invalid state. The µC can turn on any number of high
side outputs at the same time, but the high side drivers are only running within
their specs when (1) a single output is on at a given time, and (2) when that
input does not stay on, but is swiftly cycled between each of the possible 16
outputs.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the low side driver only runs within its specs when only a single
high side line is on.</p>
<p>In other words, simply stopping the program while the LEDs are on could destroy
one of the high side drivers. And a programming error that turns on more than a
single line at a time on the high side could destroy both the high side
and the low side driver.</p>
<p>While I was first researching components, I considered this and my instinct was
to build safety into the external circuitry. I added two 74HC238 3-to-8 line
demultiplexers to the BOM, intending to set up a circuit that would make it
impossible for the µC to turn on more than a single line at a time on the high
side drivers.</p>
<p>Then I realized that this would only protect against one of the two possible
error scenarios, so I decided on two other safety meassures, weaker because they
were not entirelly external to the STM32. I wired the blanking pin on the high
side driver to a GPIO pin on the STM32L, and I added an external pull up
resistor to the blanking pin on the low side driver. Because the STM32
automatically leaves most of its GPIO pins floating when it is reset, the pull
up resistor will turn all the lines of the low side driver off while the STM32
is in a reset state and before that particular pin has both been configured as
an output pin and has been set low in the firmware.</p>
<p>The intended usage for the high side blanking pin was that, after modifying the
program, I would first start the program with the high side driver blanking pin
on, then verify with a scope that the signals were correct, then restart the
program with the blanking pin off. Of course, I only bothered to do this a few
times in the beginning, and then I started modifying the program without trying
it first with the blanking pin on.</p>
<p>So, after working with the program for a while, I eventually introduced a bug
that turned all the high side pins, except one, on at once (it did the reverse
of what it was intended to do). However, I was lucky, and no chips were
destroyed. Turning on all lines at once caused the low side driver to &#8220;see&#8221; 16
LEDs coupled in parallel on each of its outputs, but its current limitation
circuitry still worked, so the total on each line was still only 20mA, which is
a current that the high side drivers can easily handle on each output
simultaneously. It ran like this for a few minutes, during which time the author
of the buggy firmware was scratching his head, wondering why there was a dim
light in all of the LEDs at the same time.</p>
<p>I also had a few instances where a single high side line was left on for maybe
30 seconds or so.</p>
<p>So, if the design had been as vulnerable to these conditions as I thought it
was, my strategy of not creating real safety in the external circuitry would
have fried one or more of the chips.</p>
<p>Actual implementations of such safety features probably vary a lot based on how
critical the application is. For many applications, there might be no safety, or
maybe only the prototype had safety. In other cases, there are probably many
layers of safety in the production system. For instance, one would hope that a
CT machine does not rely exclusively on firmware to turn off the x-ray generator
in a timely manner.</p>

<p>So, after making this device, one might want to actually use it for something.
The STM32 chip comes with a bunch of peripherals built in: USB 2, SPI, I²C,
USART, timers, PWM generators, temperature sensor, multichannel ADC, DACs, LCD
driver and real-time clock, so projects of this type are easily possible:</p>
<p>MP3 player, audio recorder, audio visualization (equalizer bars, frequency
transforms), temperature control and monitoring, &#8220;lie detector&#8221;,
electrocardiogram, simple games (Snake, Tetris, Pong), weather clock, real time
date and time with reminders, multimeter. By adding a network stack (such as
XPort), it can be hooked onto the web and display stock tickers, news headlines
and tweets.</p>

<h3>Physically connecting components on a breadboard<a class="headerlink" href="#physically-connecting-components-on-a-breadboard" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Draw an outline of the components on the underside of the breadboard and mark
their pin #1 locations.</li>
<li>Mark pin #1 locations on the top side as well.</li>
<li>When flipping the card over to work on the opposite side, always flip it over
the vertical axis. It&#8217;s less confusing than flipping it over the horizontal
axis because it&#8217;s easier to work with a mirror image than one that is upside
down. Still, make sure to use the drawing and find pin #1 to reorient, so that
the new changes or connections are not made in a mirror image of what was
intended.</li>
<li>Use sockets for the components, because:<ul>
<li>The design can be powered up without the components first to see if there
are any short circuits.</li>
<li>VCC / GND and other connections can be checked on the socket before it&#8217;s
actually applied to the chip.</li>
<li>Troubleshooting becomes much easier. For instance, finding why the design
uses more current than anticipated.</li>
<li>If a mistake fries a component, it can be replaced without resoldering.</li>
<li>No heat is applied to the component when soldering.</li>
<li>Connections can be put under the sockets and still be visible and available
for modifications.</li>
<li>It makes it much easier to scavange the parts for other projects later :)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Adding a connection seems to take three hands. One for the soldering iron, one
for for the solder and one for the wire. Instead of holding the wire in place
while soldering it &#8220;from scratch&#8221;, cover the hole and the tip of the wire with
solder. Then put the solder aside and then heat the solder covering the hole
and push the wire through.</li>
<li>It&#8217;s easy to lose track of where a trace on the underside of the board goes
AFTER it gets to the point of the connection one intended to make. Triple
check that the trace does not go on to somewhere it shouldn&#8217;t. Be suspicios of
any trace that has more than 2 connection points.</li>
<li>Be aware that since the copper traces are on the bottom and the wires are at
the top of the board, one can&#8217;t see a complete circuit at once. When following
the connections for a circuit, each time the board is turned over, there is
a potential for losing track.</li>
<li>Don&#8217;t underestimate the potential for confusion. Tripple check before adding a
new connection or cutting a trace.</li>
<li>CAT 5 or CAT 6 network cable is perfect to use for the wired connections on
both solder and solderless breadboards. The cables have a single copper lead,
which is always of the same diameter since the cables have to work with
standardized crimping RJ-45 connectors. One piece of network cable yields
8 wires of different colors. And, unlike other wires I have tried, the jackets
do not easily melt while soldering.</li>

<li>When setting a connection up on a solderless breadboard, everything is done
from the top, which prevents all the confusion of having to deal with a mirror
image and two different views of the circuit.</li>

<h2>Alternative design<a class="headerlink" href="#alternative-design" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>A common way to do this kind of LED matrix is to use a design based on parts:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>2x 74HC164 (8-bit shift register)</li>
<li>2x ULN2803 (8 Darlington driver)</li>
<li>16x 100OHM resistor or DIP resistor packs</li>
</ul>
<p>The problem with this method is that no 74HC164 chips are rated for the 8x20 =
160mA total output that will fully light up a row of regular 20mA LEDs.
Typically, the 74 chips have an absolute max of 50mA. Still, apparently, it
works (at least for a while).</p>
<p>Also, as the are no constant current drivers, the brightness of the LEDs will
probably be uneven. And since the 74HC164 are operated well beyond their specs,
the brightness of the LEDs will probably vary as different numbers of LEDs are
lit.</p>
