Mounting standard 92mm fans on a Twin Frozr II
==============================================

.. note:: See :ref:`twin_frozr_80mm` for an alternate method for 80mm fans.

This method was contributed by Jody Flint from the UK.

92mm fans are mounted at an angle on the heatsink. They are held in place by
wires threaded through holes in the heatsink.

Jody says: After a fairly brief (15min) full load test they reached only 46'C,
and quickly returned to an idle temp of 23'C.
