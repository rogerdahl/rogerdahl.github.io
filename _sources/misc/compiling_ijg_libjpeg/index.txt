How to compile the IJG JPEG library (libjpeg) for Visual Studio 2010
====================================================================

This procedure should also work for Visual Studio 2012 and later.

* Go to http://www.ijg.org/files and download the latest version of the JPEG
  library. As of Oct 2013, that is version 9, at
  http://www.ijg.org/files/jpegsr9.zip

* Unzip the package.

* Open a Visual Studio Command Prompt:

  * Type "prompt" in Windows 7 Start, or go to Microsoft Visual Studio 2010 /
    Visual Studio Tools.
  * On a 64 bit machine, just use the regular x86 command prompt.

* In the command prompt, CD to the root of the uncompressed library directory.

* Create Visual Studio project files::

  > nmake -f makefile.vc setup-v10

* Close the command prompt.

* Open the jpeg.sln file from Windows Explorer.

* Build the desired version by adjusting the property pages for the project:

  * Set runtime to match the rest of yor project:

    * ``Configuration Properties > C/C++ > Code Generation``

  * Set up x64 build:

    * ``Configuration Manager > Active Solution Platform > New``

  * Note that building a DLL does not work (A DLL is created but it is not
    usable as there are no exported symbols).

* To use the library:

  * Add the root folder of the library to the include search path. For
    instance, ``C:\jpegsr9\jpeg-9``

    * ``Configuration Properties > C/C++ > General > Additional Include Directories``

  * Add the appropriate folder with a compiled binary to the lib path. For
    instance, ``C:\jpegsr9\jpeg-9\Release``

    * ``Configuration Properties > Linker > Additional Library Directories``
