FLAC to MP3
===========

Convert FLAC to MP3 while preserving the metadata (tags).


Usage
-----

Run flac_to_mp3.py in the folder that contains the FLAC files.

The following tags are preserved: artist, album, year, tracknumber, title and genre.


Install
-------

This script is tested on Linux.

* Install the FLAC package.
* Install the LAME package.
* Download the flac_to_mp3.py script.
* The script uses high quality settings for Lame. The settings can be changed
  by changing the lame_opts string in the script.


Implementation
--------------

Strategy
~~~~~~~~

* Use **metaflac** (normally included with FLAC) to get the metadata.
* Use the **FLAC** and **LAME** command line utilities for doing the conversion.
