.. note:: This application is outdated -- it does not support the "partxx" format
 for RAR archives and it does not support the PAR2 file format.

Multismart -- Multipart Archive Tool
====================================

Multismart is primarily a tool that groups files. Instead of displaying long
lists of related files like you see in a regular file view, Multismart groups
the files and displays the groups along with statistics about the groups.

Multismart integrates the display of disk files, RAR archives, PAR files, SFV
files, Descript.ion files and calculated information to show you a complete
overview of the state of all your archives.

Quick Start
-----------

This application should be fairly intuitive, but there are some details you need
to know before you start. I'll try to keep this short. Read the Features in
Detail section below if you would like to know more.

Installing and Starting the Application
```````````````````````````````````````

Starting the application is as easy as unzipping the file and starting the
application. No installation is necessary. The application is a single
executable file. It touches only the folders you monitor and it creates one key
in the registry where it stores your settings.

Monitoring Folders
``````````````````

After you point Multismart to a folder that contains multipart archives, the
application will monitor that folder. You will see one or more lines of text in
Multismart's main window. Each line is an "item". An item can be a real file
that exists on disk, a file that Multismart learned about by reading another
file or a piece of calculated information. The "Show existing and missing" check
boxes turn on display of existing files and missing files. When both of these
are turned off you see only archive items. Each archive item displays statistics
about one distinct archive that exists in part or in whole on your hard drive.
It is in this mode that Multismart is most useful. When you turn on display of
existing and or missing files you clutter up the display without receiving much
more information.

Interpreting the display
````````````````````````

For this short description, I will focus on archive items. An archive item is in
one of three states marked by the names "archive", "archive pending" and
"archive guess" in the Type column. When Multismart first reads the monitored
folder, it only finds filenames and file sizes. Multismart is able to make a
number of educated guesses about your archives from this information alone, but
they are still only guesses. In particular, there may be undetected errors in
the archive parts and the filenames may be misleading as to which archives the
parts belong to. If checksum information exists for an archive in the form of
PAR or SFV files, the archive item is in the state of "archive pending" until
Multismart has verified the checksums of all the parts, after which the state
changes to "archive". If no checksum information exists, the archive item is
displayed as "archive guess" and left at that.

The quickest way to describe how to interpret the information that Multismart
displays is probably to use an example. Imagine that you're downloading a
multipart RAR archive called BigArchive that consists of 5 parts (rar, r00, r01,
r02, r03). Here's what happens as you get the parts in random order:

Lets say the first archive part you get is BigArchive.r02. Seeing this file
alone, Multismart knows there's an archive called BigArchive that has at least 4
parts (rar, r00, r01, r02). It will then display an archive guess item saying
"size ok, have 1 of 4 or more parts". (**archive guess, size ok, 1 / 4+**). It's
the best it can do at this point.

Adding BigArchive.r03: The last file in an archive is almost always shorter than
the other files. When Multismart sees that this file is shorter than
BigArchive.r02, it makes a guess that r03 is the last part and alters the
archive guess item to say "size ok, have 2 of 5 parts". (**archive guess, size
ok, 2 / 5**).

Adding BigArchive.rar but it is truncated by a download error: Multismart sees
that the new part is shorter than expected and adds a size error to the display.
(**archive guess, size error: 1, 2 / 5**). As you see, the part with the size
error doesn't count towards the number of parts.

Adding a parity file for the archive, say BigArchive.p02: Multismart no longer
has to make guesses on the archive, and it will display an archive pending item
until it is done calculating checksums and verifying all files in the archive.
It will then display an archive item saying that two files are missing or have
checksum errors and that one of those errors is being covered by a parity file.
(**archive, md5 error: 1, 3 / 5 (1 / 1)**). Read about parity archives below if
you don't undertand this. The number in parentheses shows that 1 out of 1
available parity files were used for coming up with the total of 3 / 5 parts
present.

Adding another parity archive and archive part, say BigArchive.p03 and
BigArchive.r00: The archive is now complete because the two parity archives can
be used for fixing one truncated file (BigArchive.rar) and one missing file
(BigArchive.r01). This is displayed as **archive, complete, 5 / 5 (2 / 2)**.
Multismart will then automatically fix the archive the next time you click the
par button. After this, the par files are deleted, and the archive displays
simply as **archive, complete, 5 / 5**.

Caution and Tips
----------------

Like all powerful tools, this one can do some serious damage if you don't use it
right. Tips for the beginner are:

When performing Delete operations, carefully look at the list of actual files in
the confirmation dialog to see what you are deleting. If you are unsure how a
specific file ended up in the delete list, try selecting items one at a time and
click Delete to see which of them imply deleting the file in question.

If you ever wonder how Multismart came up with a specific piece of information,
turning on display of existing and missing files may help.

If you don't understand how a specific combination of files resulted in what is
being displayed, you can point Multismart to an empty folder, and move files in
and out of that folder one at a time while refreshing the display after each
move. You'll then see exactly what's going on.

What is a Parity Archive?
-------------------------

Parity archives are files with an extension of .Pxx (P01, P02 etc). They protect
a set of files by storing redundant information derived from the files in the
set. The redundant information can be used to restore broken and missing files
in the protected set of files. Think of a parity archive as a "wildcard" file --
it will replace any one broken file in the set. Any two parity archives will
replace any two broken files and so on.

How does it work? Consider this simple example: Say you have 4 files, each
storing a single number. Let's choose the random numbers 3, 4, 9 and 5. You now
create a file containing the sum of all the numbers, which is 21. This file is
the "parity archive". If you now lose a random file of the 4 original files, say
file 3, you can find the lost number by taking the number stored in the parity
archive and subtracting the numbers stored in all the files you do have: 21 - 3
- 4 - 5 = 9.

Parity archives let you use any number of random parity files generated for a
set to fix the same number of random broken files in the set and this makes the
math very complicated, but you get the idea. Note that because of a mathematical
weakness in the PAR system there are some combinations of files that can not be
restored. These combinations are very rare though.

Limitations
-----------

Only RAR archives are supported. The first archive part must be ".RAR", not
".EXE".

Multismart assumes that a set of PAR parents cover exactly one archive. It will
not display information about archives correctly if the archives are covered
only in part by a PAR set, or one PAR set covers more than one archive.

Multismart relies almost entirely on filenames for grouping files into the
archives they are part of. So if you, for some weird reason, have files that
have the exact same names but are parts of different archives, that will confuse
Multismart.


Multismart Features in Detail
-----------------------------

In the following, I use the terms "PAR/SFV parent" and "PAR/SFV child". A
PAR/SFV parent is a file with the extension of .SFV, PAR, Pxx or Qxx where xx is
a number between 00 and 99. The files contain lists of files and corresponding
checksums. Pxx and Qxx files also contain recovery data -- more about that later.
A PAR/SFV child is a file that is listed in one of these files. A PAR set is a
collection of PAR parents that all have the same children and those children.

Monitored folder overview
`````````````````````````

Without running any additional functions you can check which archives you have,
how many parts you have and how many parts are missing in each archive, in which
time period the archive parts were created on disk, if any parts of an archive
failed MD5/CRC32 (if the archive has a PAR/SFV parent), the size status of each
archive (if the archive does not have a PAR/SFV parent), Descript.ion
information for the first existing archive part and which archives have PAR/SFV
parents.

By turning on "show existing files" you can also read the Descript.ion
information for each existing part of the archive, check the MD5/CRC32 status
for each file (if the archive has a PAR/SFV parent), delete individual archive
parts (for instance those with MD5/CRC32 errors) and see other files you have in
your monitored folder.

By turning on "show missing files" you will also find details about all PAR/SFV
children that don't exist in your monitored folder and all files that don't
exist in the monitored folder or in any PAR/SFV parents but still need to be
present to complete an archive (gaps).

Details
```````

Here's a list of the different items you may see and what the information
displayed in the items mean.

Archive items
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Archive items display information about archives. The information is (from left
to right):

Number of days since a part of this archive was first created, number of days
since a part of this archive was last created, size of all files that exist on
disk, estimated size of the complete archive (if the archive is not yet
complete), number of parts that exist on disk, number of parts in this archive
(guestimate) and status field (described below).

Status field:

:complete: All the known parts of the archive are present. The number of known
 parts was found from a PAR/SFV parent, and there are no MD5/CRC32 errors.

:complete?: All the known parts of the archive are present. The number of
 known parts were found by assuming that the part found on disk that has the
 highest sequence extension is the last part because it is smaller than the other
 parts (the last part will almost always be smaller). If the last part found has
 been truncated by an error, it may not be correct that this archive is complete.
 MD5/CRC32 has not been calculated, but all the parts have the correct size (the
 size of the last part has not been checked).

 OR

 A single archive part is present and that archive does not have a part number
 AND it does not have any parents AND it does not have a size that is a round
 number (as almost all parts of multipart archives have).

:md5/crc bad: A PAR/SFV parent exists. One or more parts of the archive have
 MD5/CRC32 errors. "md5 bad" is displayed if there's a PAR parent, and "crc bad"
 if there's an SFV parent.

:size bad: No PAR/SFV parents exist. One or more parts of the archive do not
 have the expected size.

:pending: A PAR/SFV parent exists. MD5/CRC32 has not been calculated for one
 or more of the files. Use the CRC button to run MD5/CRC32 calculations.

:open error: One or more files could not be opened for MD5/CRC32 calculation.
 They are probably open in another application. Use the MD5/CRC32 button to run
 MD5/CRC32 calculations later.

:<blank>: One or more parts are missing, but the parts that do exist seem to
 be ok.

The guestimated numbers may or may not have a "+" behind them. If they don't
have a "+", that means that the archive has a PAR/SFV parent and so Multismart
can be reasonably certain that the exact number of parts in the archive is
known. If there is a "+", there were no PAR/SFV parents and a guess was made
based on the same logic as described in the "complete?" section above.

Disk items
~~~~~~~~~~

Disk items represent real files that exist on disk.

Status field:

:crc ok: File exists on disk and has a PAR/SFV parent. The MD5/CRC32 for the
 disk file has been calculated and corresponds to the one listed in the PAR/SFV
 parent.

:crc bad: File exists on disk and has a PAR/SFV parent. The MD5/CRC32 for the
 disk file has been calculated but it does not correspond to the one listed in
 the PAR/SFV parent

:pending: File exists on disk and has a PAR/SFV parent. The MD5/CRC32 for the
 disk file has not yet been calculated so it is not known whether the MD5/CRC32
 is correct or not.

:size ok: File exists on disk but it does not have a PAR/SFV parent. The file
 is considered to be part of an archive and the size of the file is the same as
 the size of other parts of the archive.

:size bad: File exists on disk but it does not have a PAR/SFV parent. The file
 is considered to be part of an archive but the size of the file is not the same
 as the size of other parts of the archive.

:<blank>: File exists on disk but it does not have a PAR/SFV parent. File is
 not considered to be part of an archive.

PAR/SFV child items
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

PAR/SFV child items represent files that are listed in a PAR and/or SFV file
(parent) but do not exist on disk.

Info1 field:

The name of the PAR/SFV parent the child comes from.

If the same child item exists in both a PAR parent and an SFV parent, the
information stored in the PAR parent takes precedence because the checksums
stored in PAR parents are more secure.

Gap items
~~~~~~~~~

Gap items represents gaps in the logical sequence of archive parts. For
instance, if a file named BigArchive.r02 exists and no other BigArchive files
exist, gap items will be created for BigArchive.RAR and BigArchive.r01.

No more information is given about gap items.


PAR Resolver
````````````

Clicking the "PAR" button starts the PAR Resolver which attempts to fix all
known archives that have errors. The PAR Resolver searches each archive for
broken files. If it finds any broken files, it searches for healthy PAR parents
to use for fixing those files. If enough PAR parents are found, an attempt is
made to fix the archive. If, for any reason at all, the attempt fails, all
involved files are left exactly as they were. If on the other hand, fixing the
archive is successful, as verified by thoroughly checking all involved files
using MD5 checksums, the PAR parents are deleted as they no longer have any
value.

This function ignores names of files. It works exclusively based on file MD5
checksums, eliminating the possibility that any error is made because of mangled
filenames or filename collisions. This approach maximizes the chance that an
archive is fixed because all relevant files will be used no matter what their
filenames are. After an archive has been completely fixed, all files in the
archive are renamed to match the names of the files as they are listed in the
PAR parents. This maximizes the chance that you will be able to successfully
extract the archive.

Note: Any file that has not yet been MD5/CRC32'ed is effectively invisible to
this function. So, to fix as many archives as possible, use this function after
all files have been MD5/CRC32'ed.

Duplicate Cleanup and Fixing Archives
`````````````````````````````````````

Clicking the "Dup" button starts the duplicate cleanup process. This function
automates fixing archives by replacing original broken files with duplicate
intact files. It also automatically deletes duplicates of intact original files.

Multismart's Dup function works on the assumption that all of the following
files are the same file:

| BigArchive.r03
| BigArchive-0001.r03
| BigArchive-0002.r03
| BigArchive-(0001).r03
| Copy of BigArchive.r03
| Copy (2) of BigArchive.r03

As you see, I'm attempting to cover any automatic renaming scheme that may have
been applied to your files. If, for some reason, you have archives with names
like above that are actually different archives, you should not use this
function.

The basic rules for renaming and deleting files
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The best way to describe what Dup does is probably by examples:

If BigArchive.r03 has the correct size, or better, a correct MD5/CRC32 checksum
(verified by a PAR/SFV parent), all other permutations of BigArchive.r03 will be
deleted (as specified above).

If BigArchive.r03 has an incorrect size or an incorrect MD5/CRC32 checksum
(again as verified by a PAR/SFV parent), all permutations of BigArchive.r03 will
be searched for one that matches the required size or MD5/CRC32. If one is
found, the original BigArchive.r03 file is replaced with the found file, and all
other BigArchive.r03 files are deleted.

Note: To avoid that files such as newyears-1998.r03 confuse the function, it is
a requirement that the two first digits of the -nnnn sequence are 00. This will
only be a problem if you have more than 100 duplicates of a file.

Select, Delete, Copy and Missing
````````````````````````````````

These functions work together to let you delete specific archives and create
lists of archives to use for different purposes.

Creating Selections
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Manual and semi-automatic selections
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Delete, Copy and Missing functions work on items that you have selected. You
can select multiple items manually in the normal Microsoft Way by clicking items
while pressing the shift and/or ctrl keys, or semi-automatically by
double-clicking the following items:

=================  ==========================================
Double-click Item  Effect
=================  ==========================================
Archive            select all parts of the archive
archive part       select all parts of the archive
.SFV file          select all the children of the .SFV file
.PAR file          select all the children of the .PAR file
=================  ==========================================

Automatic Selections
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Select function selects archives that match your criteria. Use the For
Delete tab to select items to delete (archives that have MORE than a certain
number of missing parts), and use the For Copy / Missing tab to select items to
request (archives that have LESS than a certain number of missing parts).

Note that the Select function only performs the selection. After the selection
has been done, you can view and modify the selection by clicking items while
holding the ctrl key before starting one of the functions described below.

Delete
~~~~~~

Delete all marked items. Note that deleting a archive item will delete the
entire archive. Deleting "PAR only", "SFV only" or "gap" items is not possible
since they don't exist on disk. These items will disappear automatically when
the actual files that they display information about are deleted.

After clicking *Delete*, a confirmation dialog will appear. The dialog shows you
exactly which files will be deleted if you complete the function.

Copy
~~~~

Copy a list of filenames to the Clipboard. If you have made a selection that
implicitly selects more than one type of items, a dialog box will appear where
you can specify what kind of items you would like to include in your list.
Existing files are files that are actually present in your monitored folder and
virtual files are files that are missing in your monitored folder but which
Multismart thinks are needed for creating complete archives.

Missing
~~~~~~~

Copy a list of missing files to the Clipboard in a compact format. For instance,
if *Copy* would have generated the following list:

| BigArchive.r03
| BigArchive.r04
| BigArchive.r05
| BigArchive.r10
| AnotherArchive.r08

*Missing* will generate the following list:

| BigArchive r03-r05, r10
| AnotherArhive.r08

*Missing* automatically excludes files that exist in your monitored folder, even
if they are in your selection.

Refresh
~~~~~~~

When you first open a folder and then each time you click the Refresh button,
the folder is scanned for new files, and special files are opened and scanned.
This can be a lengthy process if you have a huge amount of files in the folder.
After the folder is scanned, MD5/CRC32 calculations of any new files are
started. This can take a very long time, but you may work with the application
during this process. Be aware though that any uncalculated files are invisible
to all PAR functions. So, to increase the chance that PAR functions succeed,
wait until all MD5/CRC32 calculations are finished before running them.

To avoid hard drive trashing, simultaneous MD5/CRC32 calculations of different
folders on the same drive are queued and executed consecutively while
calculations of folders on different drives are executed concurrently.

Keyboard Shortcuts
``````````````````

================= ============================================================
Key               Function
================= ============================================================
Ctrl-D, Delete    Delete
Ctrl-C            Copy
Ctrl-R            Missing
A - Z             Jump to item in list
F5                Refresh
================= ============================================================

Automatic Descript.ion cleaning
```````````````````````````````

If you have Descript.ion files, Multismart will display
the information about files that is records there. To prevent the Descript.ion
database from growing too big, Multismart also keeps track of how much unused
information it contains. If more than 50% of the information in the database is
unused, you are given the option to remove the unused data. The unused data is
descriptions of files that no longer exist.

SFV Function
````````````

Multismart integrates functionality similar to that of QuickSFV, FastSFV and
WinSFV.

File MD5/CRC32 performance in Multismart should equal or exceed that of the
applications mentioned above because it uses the fastest disk access method
provided by Windows.

Note that because MD5/CRC32 is a lengthy process; Multismart runs the MD5/CRC32
processes on a priority that is slightly lower than default. There is a
potential disadvantage in that if you run less "courteous" applications that
perform lengthy operations at higher priorities, Multismart will wait until
these are done before doing work itself. The advantage is that you will see very
little impact on the usability of your computer while the MD5/CRC32 process
runs.

Notes on implementation
-----------------------

Known bugs
``````````

None.

Known minor issues
``````````````````

When the descript.ion cleaning dialog pops up, the progress dialog goes behind
the main window.

If a file is deleted before the MD5/CRC32 process gets to it, it is displayed
with "open error". For non-programmers, this is probably not intuitive. The file
should be marked with "removed" or should just disappear.

When "Show" state is changed, should jump to item that had focus.

Files with MD5/CRC32 errors
```````````````````````````

Multismart currently considers files with MD5/CRC32 errors absent even though it
might be possible to recover the file if it is a RAR part that was created with
the "recovery" option. The best way for Multismart to deal with such RAR parts
would probably be to detect if they were created with a recovery option and then
try to recover it, but for now, that is not implemented.

The file database, .Multismart
``````````````````````````````

Multismart maintains a database of file MD5s and CRCs, so that it doesn't have
to MD5/CRC32 the same file several times. Multismart also stores information
such as last modified date and size of all existing files in this database. This
prevents Multismart from making any mistakes if you change or overwrite files.
The name of the database file is .Multismart and it is stored in the monitored
folder. It you delete this file while Multismart is running, Multismart will
automatically restore it, but if you delete it when Multismart is not running,
Multismart has to MD5/CRC32 all your files again before it can display full
information about the archives the next time you start it.

Uninstall
---------

Uninstalling Multismart is as easy as removing the executable file and removing
the following key from the registry:

HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\RDahl\Multismart

Multiple instances
------------------

It should not be necessary to run multiple instances of Multismart because you
can monitor as many folders as you like with a single instance of the program.
However, you can run multiple instances of Multismart as long as you point them
to different monitored folders. If you try to run two or more instances of
Multismart pointing to the same monitored folder you may get inconsistent
results as instances bicker over the data in the database files (.Multismart and
Descript.ion).

Only the settings from the last instance you close will be retained because
instances will share the Registry key.

"Double" selections
-------------------

If you select both a archive item and one or more corresponding archive parts
that exist on disk, you have essentially selected some items multiple times
because archive items are virtual items and refer directly to the real items.
Deleting this selection will cause the real items to be deleted twice as hard --
just kidding :)

The rule is that Multismart will always try to process as many files as possible
when you select files both implicitly (through selecting an archive item or a
PAR/SFV parent) and explicitly (through select corresponding archive parts or
PAR/SFV children) at the same time.

Finding how many parts of which a RAR archive consists
------------------------------------------------------

The RAR archive format does not provide a way to find directly how many parts
make up a given RAR archive. Multismart deals with this problem in the following
way.

Without a PAR/SFV parent
````````````````````````

Multismart knows that RAR archives consist of many parts. If Multismart sees the
following two files:

| BigArchive.r05
| BigArchive.r07

it knows that there is a RAR archive called "BigArchive" that has at least 9
parts (RAR, r00 - r07) where two parts are present and the rest are missing. It
looks at the size of the last known file (r07 in this case) and compares it to
the size of the other files in the archive. If the file is smaller, chances are
that it is the last file of the archive. If the file is the same size, there are
probably files beyond r07 but there is no good way for Multismart to find out
how many.

With an PAR/SFV parent
``````````````````````

If there is a PAR/SFV parent, Multismart uses it to find out how many parts an
archive consists of. It will also use the checksums in the SFV file to check if
there are checksum errors in the corresponding files.

Deciding whether or not to delete the archive
---------------------------------------------

Multismart keeps track of the following key information about an archive:

How many days since the first time and the last time a part of the archive was
encountered and the number of existing and missing parts of an archive.

Multismart then compares these values with values you supply to find out if a
particular archive should be selected for deletion. For instance, you might say
that archives where there's more than 5 missing parts and the last part was
encountered more than 2 days ago should be marked.

If a few new parts of the now deleted archive appear later, they will
automatically be marked for deletion when you run the function with the same
criteria again.
